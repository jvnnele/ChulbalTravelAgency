				<p>It's all in Bohol.<br><br>

	Another gem of the Visayas, Bohol is a tropical haven of natural beauty. The coastline of the island is skimmed by gentle coves and white sand beaches. 

In addition to white sand beaches and dive spots, Bohol is famous among other sights, for its Chocolate Hills, the Tarsier – arguably the world’s smallest primate, heritage sites and old stone churches.

Rest assured that when you saw the places in person, you will never regret going in this travel destination. Be amazed and know what are the places that you can visit in Bohol:<br><br></p>

<p class="destination">Chocolate Hills<br><br>
The Chocolate Hills are Bohol's most famous tourist attraction. They look like giant mole hills, or as some say, women's breasts, and remind us of the hills in a small child's drawing. Most people who first see pictures of this landscape can hardly believe that these hills are not a man-made artifact. However, this idea is quickly abandoned, as the effort would surely surpass the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which, at the end of the dry season, turns chocolate brown. From this color, the hills derive their name. At other times, the hills are green, and the association may be a bit difficult to make.<br><br>

<p class="destination">Hinagdanan Cave<br><br>
The name of the cave, which means laddered, came from the way it was discovered. The place was accidentally discovered when the owner of the area was clearing the decaying branches of the land when he found the hole. The owner threw a stone into the hole, then he heard a splash. Then he built a ladder to get into the cave.<br><br>
	
	 Aside from its awe-inspiring natural beauty, Hinagdanan also holds a bit of history from the Second World War. The cave was once used as a hideout by the locals to escape from the Japanese Imperial army, but unfortunately they were still found.<br><br>
	
	Hinagdanan is a karst cave which means it is made of limestones. Boasting several stalactite and stalagmite formations parallel to each other and a fresh water lagoon that is about 10 to 12 meters deep.
