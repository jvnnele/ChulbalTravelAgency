	<p>Cebu City is the capital city of the province of Cebu and is the oldest city in the Philippines. It is regarded as the “Queen City of the South.” Being such, it is a center for commerce, trade, education and tourism. It is one of the most sought after tourist destination in the Philippines. Furthermore, it is an accessible place for tourists because the second largest and busiest airport in the nation is located in Mactan Island and is just near Cebu City.</p><br>

<p class="destination">Cebu Taoist Temple<br><br>
Built in 1972, this landmark aims to preserve the teachings of Lao-Tse, the 600 B.C. Chinese philosopher. While it was not built for tourism purposes, it caught the attention of travelers because of its peculiar and artistic appeal. Entrance to the temple is reminiscent of the Great Wall of China. In addition, it also gives an overlooking view of the city from its spacious balcony. It has two temples, namely Phu Sian Temple and the Main Temple, which is open even to non-shippers.

<p class="destination">Magellan's Cross<br><br>
Within walking distance from the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño, there lies a kiosk-like structure which houses the famous Magellan’s Cross. While Filipinos consider Ferdinand Magellan a villain in Philippine history, this landmark is considered one of the most important historical markers in Cebu City. That’s because it was established upon Magellan’s order to mark his arrival in the country. This also serves as a reminder of the birth of Christianity in the Philippines. While the original cross is enclosed in tingalo wood for preservation and protection, there are rumours that the original cross was destroyed after Magellan’s death.</p><br>

<p class="destination">Basilica Minore Del Santo Niño De Cebu<br><br>
See the revered flemish statuette of the Child Jesus (Santo Niño) at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño to say a prayer or two. The image of the Santo Niño has remarkable value, especially to Catholics, as it was a baptismal gift by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan to Rajah Humabon and Queen Juana, who were the first locals to be baptised on the island. Most tourists would go beyond visiting the oldest church and prefer to celebrate with locals and experience the Sinulog Festival held on the third Sunday of every year.</p><br>

<p class="destination">10,000 Roses Cafe<br><br>
The 10,000 roses cafe is located at the end of Cordova Tourism Center, just right next to Lantaw Floating Restaurant. It is owned by Miguel Cho, an interior designer. He was inspired by the famous Dongdaenum Design Plaza in South Korea. His intention in putting up the cafe is to create a romantic ambience that would be perfect for couples, a place precise for a beginning of a happily ever after.<br>
Aside from the sumptuous food in the cafe, the main attraction of the place is the 10,000 artificial LED roses that are “planted” in the open area of the facility. These roses of about 3 feet tall dance with the sea breeze in the day time and are transformed into magical lights in the night as they are lit at around 6pm every night.</p><br>
