<p class="destination">Polillo Island<br><br>
Because of its geographical location and underdeveloped state, it is still considered an off beaten track and still not well-known for most travelers, making it an advantage for those who are seeking a serene and peaceful getaway place away from the usual overcrowded tourist destinations. <br><br>
	Aside from Balesin, the main attractions it can offer can compete and even exceeds further with the most well-known established tourist spots in the country, but getting there is the most challenging part. Having to endure a roller coaster ride from the megalopolis Manila, an edgy journey through the channel from the nearest port via wooden cargo vessels, and a rough muddy ride within the town outskirts, it is a no place for a faint-hearted and typical sightseer.<br><br>
	One has to be ready for a thrilling adventure and requires travelers who are willing to endure hardships in order to reach the major attractions and experience the rustic simplicity and untouched beauty of nature.</p><br>
