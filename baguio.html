				<p>The Majestic City of Pines.<br><br>

	We all know Baguio too well with its famous and familiar cold climate, pine trees, and rich Igorot heritage. It has always been one of the most popular places to take a break from busy and stressful lives. Whether you are looking for some time to take a breather or to immerse yourself in its unspoiled culture and tradition.

Many of us have already visited Baguio not once, but a couple of times. Right now you may think you already know what you need to know. The places, activities to do, and other “basic” things a tourist should be informed of. How we wish that there was something to help us make the most of our Baguio experience?

Consider your wish granted because here is a TOURIST’S UPDATED GUIDE TO BAGUIO.<br><br></p>

Nowadays, it is the venue for the exhibit of beautiful and extraordinary bamboo art pieces.
